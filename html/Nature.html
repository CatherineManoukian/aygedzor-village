			<p class='first_paragraph'><b>Aygedzor has a unique nature, it is surrounded by mountains. There are many berries and fruits that have a special taste. Aygedzor has many forests, which are very beautiful. The fresh and beautiful nature captivates everyone, it is beautiful in all seasons. In winter it is covered with white snowflakes, which makes it even more beautiful. There are many mountains, which you can climb, and see unique trees and shrubberies.
	The majority of the population is engaged in agriculture and beekeeping. And also there’s a church being built in Aygedzor, which, in my opinion, will be very luxurious and large.
	I love to explore the forests here and enjoy the wonderful nature.<br>

				Aygedzor has many beautiful places, each stone has its own uniqueness and beauty, there is only pure nature around you. Every step you take in Aygedzor you feel the sound of nature, the call, the croaking of birds and the rustling of trees. I love our little village very much. As well as our favorite Chitavor stone, on which there are ancient inscriptions, which have been preserved to this day. There is also the monastery of St. Hripsime, near which a small church was built, the so-called chapel.
I love Aygedzor very much.
